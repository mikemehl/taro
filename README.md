# taro

taro is a personal virtual machine. I am writing it for fun. It is inspired by projects like [uxn](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html).

## Specs

- 32 bit arithmetic
- variable length opcodes
- built in "threading" model (not yet sure wether to implement actual threads or something more like coroutines)
- virtual register machine (i.e. register windows)
- vegetables
